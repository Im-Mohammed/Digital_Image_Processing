# 🌆 Digital Image Processing with OpenCV & Python

Welcome to my **Digital Image Processing** repository!  
This project is a hands-on collection of image processing techniques and experiments using **OpenCV** and **Python**.

Whether you're just starting out or exploring advanced topics, this repo offers clear, beginner-friendly scripts for understanding how computers "see" and manipulate images.

---

## 🧠 What You'll Find

Each script here covers a specific concept in image processing, such as:

- 📸 **Reading & Writing Images**
- 🌈 **Color Conversion (Grayscale, RGB)**
- 🔳 **Thresholding & Binary Conversion**
- 🌀 **Blurring (Average, Gaussian)**
- ✴️ **Edge Detection (Sobel Operator)**
- 💠 **Transformations (DFT, DCT)**
- 🧼 **Morphological Operations (Erosion, Dilation)**
